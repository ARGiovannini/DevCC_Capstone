# DevCC_Capstone
  This project explores upcoming live poker tournaments to see if any insights can be gained about the industry as a whole,
  as well as if any insights can optimize the ROI of a live tournament players schedule.

Tableau workbook (Poker Tournament Data.twbx):
  The tableau story is the first place to go to get an understading of the project as a whole:
  The first half gives base level poker information
  The second half explores various insights on upcoming poker tournaments
  The story ends with a dashboard that allows players to find poker tournaments by date and location that will offer the highest prize pool ratio
  
Selenium webscraper (tournamnet_info_scraper.ipynb):
  This notebook contains information on how to use the webscraper for this project. More itterations of this scraper will make it more optimal.
  
SQl (Poker_Tournament_Data.sql):
  This script was mostly for finding insights and exploring the data to find out what was going on
  Almost all of this data is on the Tableau story
  
cleaned_poker_data.csv:
  This is the final CSV used in the SQL and Tableau step
  
All other CSV's:
  Other CSV's are not necessary, they were used in order to make sure I had all of the correct information in the final CSV
